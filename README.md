## Installing Dolphin Emulator
- Download the zip file `Dolphin_Emulator.7z`
- Unzip to an easy to access location, I used C:\Dolphin\

## Installing Monster Hunter Tri
- Download the zip file `MHTri.7z`
- Unzip to a new folder in your Dolphin folder C:\Dolphin\Games\


## Running Dolphin Emulator
- Navigate to the Dolphin-x64 folder C:\Dolphin\Dolphin-x64
- Run `Dolphin.exe`
- Double click to set games directory to folder where MHTri is located C:\Dolphin\Games\
- Ensure MHTri shows up as a selectable game


## Setting up the MHTri Server
Once you have added MHTri as a game to your dolphin emulator, its time to establish a connection to the private server
- Download and unzip `MH3SP-Riivolution.zip` to desired location, I used the same folder as my games folder (C:\Dolphin\Games\)
- Run `Dolphin.exe` to open the Dolphin Emulator
- Right click on Monster Hunter Tri
- Select "Start with Riivolution Patches..."
- Select "Open Riivolution XML..." at the bottom
- Navigate to the folder where you unzipped the file (C:\Dolphin\Games\riivolution\)
- Select `MH3SP.xml`
- Select "Save as Preset..." at the bottom
- Name it something like "MH3SP SERVER" and save
- Close out of "Start with Riivolution Patches..." window and ensure a new game appears with the title you entered
- Everytime you want to launch the game to play on LocLac servers, select "MH3SP SERVER"
